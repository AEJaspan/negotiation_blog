# Studies on agentic Negotiation 

This project is just an extension of independent research I have been performing to explore how AI models negotiate and collaborate using a multi-turn prisoners dilemma as the framing.

Previously I have studied how allowing LLMs to directly converse will affect their gameplay strategies. This work can be found [here](https://github.com/AEJaspan/negotiation_demos).

In this project, I have studied the difference in gameplay strategies that different size models, and models of differing providers will affect game play strategies.

These studies are a WIP.
